# Dijkstra-Hadoop-and-Spark
The task is to find shortest paths from a source node to all other nodes in the graph. This problem is solved by the Dijkstra’s algorithm, which is sequential. The project has a double purpose. First get familiar with Dijkstra’s algorithm, then devise a MapReduce version of the algorithm. As you will realise, the process is actually iterative, so the identified MapReduce job must be iterated a certain number of times. Provide both a Python-Hadoop streaming and Spark implementation of the algorithm, and test it on the simple graph data provided in classes.
